# Tutorial
Trying to figure out how this thing works. . . 

. . . We'll see what happens . . .
    am I blue?
    Tabs don't quite the same here. If something is tabbed, but not separated by an extra line from the main text, it goes on the same line as the line above it.
    
    But if it is separated by an extra line of nothing, it goes in that funny little grey box where you show code
    
    Not quite sure what's going on
    
    
    Do tabs stay like they do in Notepad++?
    Looks like they do.
      They'll even collectively tab and back tab.
        J'ai h√¢te. ;)
        Mais je ne comprends pas pourquoi c'est bleu.
